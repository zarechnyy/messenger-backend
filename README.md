# MyMessenger
# How to start?
To start backend you should [install and configure](https://golang.org/doc/install)  Go locally.

You need to install dependency manager for golang
```sh
$ brew install glide
```
Then just clone git repo with backend:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/zarechnyy/messenger-backend
```
After that you need download dependencies in cloned repo
```sh
$ glide install
```

Then just start server
```sh
$ go run main.go
```
